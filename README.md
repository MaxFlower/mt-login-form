# Here is the implementation of a Login form

- no libs, no frameworks, just plain JS, HTML and CSS
- based on standards and best practices

What's inside:
- semantic template
- enabling/disabling the submit button based on the validity of the fields
- differentiated 'input' and 'change' events to guarantee better UX
- visible/hidden form error messages
